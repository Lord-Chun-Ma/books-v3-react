# About Books app

> This app makes use of props, event and state systems to add a book from user input and be displayed in a list

> User then will be able to remove the said book or click on the ✏ button to edit and update the title of the book

> However, the data in this app is local and non persistent as when user reloads the app, the data is reset everytime

> In the upcoming successive iterations of the app I will learn and implement presistent data using outside API server
