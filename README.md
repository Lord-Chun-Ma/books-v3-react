# About version 3 of the books App

> In version 3, I have learnt about context system and implemented context system in a separate context file which contains all the Application state functions and values

> Further used the context system to refactor the code and made the child component communicate directly to the functions in the context rather than passing down through each child element

> Additionally, I dabbed into a little bit of hooks and create a small custom hook that uses repetitive code logic and imported them across all the components
